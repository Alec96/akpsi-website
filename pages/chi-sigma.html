				<h4>Our Chapter</h4>
				<p>Alpha Kappa Psi's Chi Sigma Chapter was chartered in April 2014 under the core values of Brotherhood, Knowledge, Integrity, Unity, and Service. Since it's foundation, Chi Sigma often hosts events with other Boston chapters and other professional fraternities in the Northeastern University community. Additionally, members have participated in Relay for Life to support cancer research and often works with the Greater Boston Food Bank and JumpStart. We have had members attend various AKPsi professional events, such as PBLI, the Convention, and even be selected for the Academy!</p>

				<p>With Northeastern's prestigious Co-op program, our brothers strive for professional development excellence and graduate with a multitude of work experience. We are open to all majors, but seek business success. The Chi Sigma Chapter also has an exclusive consulting group for additional real-world experience:</p>

				<br />

				<p> <strong>Chi Sigma Consulting (CSC)</strong> was founded in Spring 2016 and offers pro-bono consulting services to start-ups and nonprofits headquartered in the Boston area. CSC offers a variety of services ranging from marketing, management, and financial consulting. </p>
