		<h4>The Big Picture</h4>
		<p>In 1904, Alpha Kappa Psi was founded at New York University. Its founders intended the fraternity's brothers to lead on campus and spread knowledge of the business professionalism to all interested students. The fraternity was based on five values: Brotherhood, Knowledge, Integrity, Service, and Unity. These core values are instilled in every chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi throughout the world, including ours. Over more than 100 years, the fraternity has grown to include over 200,000 members, including women. There are now over 200 chapters worldwide connecting brothers, alumni, faculty and business professionals across the globe. </p>
